#Car Stopping Distance Predictor vs Car speed

Hi, welcome to my first shiny app.
This is a simple application where I am using the cars dataset in R to predict the distance after which the car stops if the user provides the speed at which the car was moving.
The speed must be in mph and the corresponding distance will be outputed in ft.

I hope you like my first app , Because I enjoyed making it :)
